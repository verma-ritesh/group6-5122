# Data/operation abstraction design

## How did you prepare your data?
- Here are the steps we took to prepare data:
  1. Downloaded data from kaggle website
  2. Imported this data into dataframe
  3. Cleaned data and cast date alphanumeic field to data field
  4. Finally created merged dataframe called Master Data
